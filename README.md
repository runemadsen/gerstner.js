Gerstner.js
======================

Gerstner.js is an experiment in dynamically creating stylesheets via Javascript. It can be used to create generative color schemes, flexible grid systems, etc. It's still in an early stage, but look in the `examples` folder for how to use it.

If you like tests, there's also a bunch of those to help you.
